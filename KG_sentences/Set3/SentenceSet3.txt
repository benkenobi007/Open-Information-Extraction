They are working hard.										
They will be working hard.									
They had worked hard.										
They have been working hard.								
They might have been working hard.							
I'll come home when I finish work.							
You must wait here until your father comes.					
They are coming after they have had dinner.					
We won't be able to go out if it is raining.				
If Barcelona win tomorrow they will be champions.			
I will come tomorrow unless I have to look after the children.
